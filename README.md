# Weather App - Android


The Weather App is a simple Android application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. It demonstrates the usage of the MVVM architecture, Retrofit for API calls, Glide for image loading, and clean code organization. This README will provide an overview of the project, its components, and how to set it up.

## Overview

The Weather App is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating concerns for better code maintainability.

- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is used to make API requests to the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) to fetch current weather data.

- **Glide**: Glide is used for efficient loading and caching of weather condition images.

- **Clean Code**: The project is organized using clean architecture principles to ensure a clean and modular codebase.

## Features

- Display current weather conditions for a user-specified location.
- Dynamic background changes based on the time of day (day or night).
- Real-time updates using the WeatherAPI.
